# Space Apps Challenge 2024: Exosky!

Your challenge is to develop an app or interface that allows a student user to select an exoplanet, uses the information in a star catalog to develop a three-dimensional point cloud (map) of stars corresponding to the perspective of an observer on that exoplanet, and then creates a visualization of this point cloud.

The translated point cloud could be visualized in different ways. Will your app produce a static image of the sky (like the sky charts or guides we have here on Earth), an interactive planetarium (potentially allowing for a virtual reality experience), or something else?

Additional capabilities such as allowing the user to trace and name constellations would help students make each unique exosky their own, enabling a deeper experience and educational opportunity. Your tool could even provide various levels of detail (star name, color, etc.) and make different visual overlays (ecliptic, galactic grid, etc.) available for more advanced uses.
